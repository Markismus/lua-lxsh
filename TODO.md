# To-do list for LXSH

 * Support for Lua's interactive mode! (this is something I miss in every other highlighter out there)
 * Create automated tests for the lexers (preferably also for the highlighters)
 * After publishing LXSH, mention it on <http://lua-users.org/wiki/LpegRecipes>
 * Lexer and highlighter for shell scripts
